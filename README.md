This repo includes all projects I completed and my thoughts/takeaways during the course of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.git

1. [Airbnb Open Data](airbnb_supply_demand): This work attempts to explore homestays experience in Boston and Seattle from both the visitors' and hosts' perspectives.
2. [Figure Eight Disaster Response Pipeline](figure8_disaster_response_pipelines): In this project, you will find an ETL pipeline that processes these data and a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that messages can be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
3. Starbucks Optimization Strategy: more to come
4. IBM Watson Article Recommendation Engine: more to come
5. Dog Image Classification Tool: more to come
