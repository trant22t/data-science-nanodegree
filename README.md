This repo includes all projects I completed and my thoughts/takeaways during the course of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

1. [Airbnb Open Data](airbnb_supply_demand): This work attempts to explore Airbnb homestays experience in Boston and 
Seattle from both the visitors' and hosts' perspectives.  

    *Major themes*: data analysis, communication to non-technical audience
2. [Figure Eight Disaster Response Pipeline](figure8_disaster_response_pipelines): In this project, you will find an ETL 
pipeline that processes real messages that were sent during disaster events and a machine learning pipeline to categorize 
these messages so that they can be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency.  

    *Major themes*: ELT pipeline, ML pipeline (bonus: `great_expectations` data validation)
     
3. [Starbucks Optimization Strategy](starbucks_optimization_strategy): This folder consists two independent pieces of 
work related to Starbucks optimization strategies for promotional offers: one is uplift modeling to determine whether a 
promotion should be provided to a user based on Incremental Response Rate and Net Incremental Revenue; another is 
customer segmentation modeling to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer types.  
  
    *Major themes*: uplift modeling, customer segmentation
    
4. IBM Watson Article Recommendation Engine: more to come
5. Dog Image Classification Tool: more to come
