This repo includes all projects I completed and my thoughts/takeaways during the course of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.

1. [Airbnb Open Data](airbnb_supply_demand): This work attempts to explore Airbnb homestays experience in Boston and 
Seattle from both the visitors' and hosts' perspectives.  

    *Major themes*: data analysis, communication to non-technical audience
2. [Figure Eight Disaster Response Pipeline](figure8_disaster_response_pipelines): In this project, you will find an ETL 
pipeline that processes real messages that were sent during disaster events and a machine learning pipeline to categorize 
these messages so that they can be sent to an appropriate disaster relief agency.  

    *Major themes*: ELT pipeline, ML pipeline (bonus: `great_expectations` data validation)
     
3. [Starbucks Optimization Strategy](starbucks_optimization_strategy): This folder consists two independent pieces of 
work related to Starbucks optimization strategies for promotional offers: one provides multiple uplift models to determine 
whether a user should be given a promotion based on Incremental Response Rate and Net Incremental Revenue; the other builds 
a customer segmentation model to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer types.  
  
    *Major themes*: uplift modeling, customer segmentation
    
4. [IBM Watson Article Recommendation Engine](ibm_articles_recommendation_engine): This project includes a recommendation 
engine to suggest articles to the users on the IBM Watson Studio platform. 

    *Major themes*: rank-based recommendations, user-user based collaborative filtering, content-based recommendations, 
    matrix factorization


5. [Dog Image Classification Tool](dog_breed_classifier): This project includes a pipeline that can be used within a web 
or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an 
estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, it will identify the resembling dog breed. 

    *Major themes*: image classification
