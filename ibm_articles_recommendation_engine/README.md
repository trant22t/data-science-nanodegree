# IBM Article Recommendation Engine

## Background
Partnering with Udacity, IBM provides us with data sets containing article contents and their Watson Studio platform's 
user interactions with these articles. In this project, you will find multiple recommendation methods, including rank-based, user-user collaborative
filtering, content-based and matrix factorization, that are used to generate list of recommended articles or predicted
interaction values.
